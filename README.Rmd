#### Definitions
* Hypotension: Hypotension is a systolic blood pressure <5th percentile of normal for age, namely:
    - <60 mm Hg in term neonates (0 to 28 days)
    - <70 mm Hg in infants (1 to 12 months)
    - <70 mm Hg + (2 x age in years) in children 1 to 10 years
    - <90 mm Hg in children â‰¥10 years of age
